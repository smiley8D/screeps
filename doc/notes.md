## TODO

- Pathing
    - Old notes
        - Especially for multirooms, I don't think I ever want it to recompute that during a run
        - Need to research and test more
        - Consider using findClosestByRange more often. Within a room it probably works quite well
            - currently testing, not much noticable impact
    - Experience so far
        - pathing is v difficult and rigid (unless complexity is added)
        - Doesn't seem like performance is taking much of a hit anyways
    - Congestion + pathing that ignores creeps
        - Consider/test GTFOTR again
            - Alternatively, look ahead and see if creep is in way? Trade places if so?
        - something like https://sy-harabi.github.io/Journey-to-Solving-the-Traffic-Management-Problem/
- Memory
    - Switch to raw memory
        - More avail
        - Selective loading instead of 100%
        - Faster parsing
    - Track task information
    - Cleanup timestamps/survey tracking/scouting tracking/etc.
    - Reconsider tracked info (esp for other owners' rooms)
- Often dramatic difference in energy change & transfers, probably to do with counters being slightly off, look in to
- Creep behaviors
    - Combat stance (aggressive, neutral, avoid?)
        - PathFinder has a flee option, could be very useful for avoidance
        - Room cost function
- Diplomacy (integrate w/ behaviors)
    - Player stance (ally, neutral, enemy?)
    - Ignore neutrals in neutral territory, engage in owned
    - Always engage enemies
    - Ignore allies in all territory
    - Switch neutral to enemy if attacked (consider territory?)
    - Switch ally to enemy if attacked a sufficient amount (probably using a moving average) (consider territory?)
    - Configurable no scouting of allies? Would be nice to set
    - Per-room overrides? Ex some rooms always treat everyone/someones hostiles, etc.
- Reservation quirks for sources
    - 300 tick reset for all, reserving/owning bumps up to 3000, unowned is 1500, center is 4000
    - Figure out how to make decisions based on this, is it worth it to get extra energy?
    - When does the downgrade happen? If a source is partially exploited, will it downgrade before reset?
- Set defense % to % of free room energy?
- Do combat first, devote CPU to it
- Military commands done via flags, flag name references an "army" or force composition which is designed elsewhere
- Tweak spawning/assignment mechanics, not a fan of the decisions being made (ie, constantly bringing in creeps from outside when in the room would work)
- Broker task + my own market interface
- Link tweaks
    - Resolve every tick, don't have creeps consider whole network? (fix issues and possible performance improvement)
- Hauler pull tasks ("Trailer?") for Drudge units not in position
- Use fewer creeps (look into combining paths? having 1 miner harvest several closeby sources?)
- Spawning/assignment, creeps on the job keep getting replaced by bigger ones that are far away/spawning
    - use some system to track when creeps are "travelling" to position? possibly useful for other things too
- Renewal probably won't work well w/o changes to depoing, stockers kept refilling ~20 energy at a time in a single extension, very slow
- "Operations", collections of tasks, more organized assignment/logistics/bottleneck identification
